### The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

1. Download the data for project and unzip to a folder say 'Course Project'
2. Put the file 'run_analysis.R' into 'Course Project' folder
3. In RStudio set your working directory to 'Course Project' folder
4. Open 'run_analysis.R' script and run it.
5.  tidy data will be saved in "tidyData.txt" file in your working directory('Course Project' folder).
- Please note you need to install "data.table" and "reshape2" packages in RStudio.
